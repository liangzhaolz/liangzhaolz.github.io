I am a current PhD student at the Department of Language and Linguistic Science, University of York (2019-). I currently work on production and perception of lexical tones of Mandarin dialects, with a particular interest in the perceptual processing of familiar and unfamiliar tone systems.  My general research areas include phonetics, phonology, speech perception, tone perception.  

Before coming to York, I received MA in Linguistics from UCL with Distinction (2017) and worked as a curriculum analyst in Offcn Education & Technology based in Beijing, China (2018).
