I am a current PhD student at the Department of Language and Linguistic Science, University of York (2019-). I currently work on production and perception of lexical tones of Mandarin dialects, with a particular interest in the perceptual processing of familiar and unfamiliar tone systems.  My general research areas include phonetics, phonology, speech perception, tone perception.  

Before coming to York, I received MA in Linguistics from UCL with Distinction (2017) and worked as a curriculum analyst in Offcn Education & Technology based in Beijing, China (2018).

Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, especially various types of noodles, typically found as homemade staple food in North China. I also play the piano for relaxation and fun. I am recently trying to practice some notes of recomposed classic music. This is just one humble practice [clip](https://video.weibo.com/show?fid=1034:4660529843863560) recorded in the summer (will denitifely practice more!) and the notes were recomposed from Chopin's Waltz No.7 in C Sharp Minor (Op.64-2) in Jay Chou's movie *Secret*.
